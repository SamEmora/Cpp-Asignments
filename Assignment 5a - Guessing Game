// Welcome to the guessing game! I'll choose a random number between 1 and a limit of your choice, and you guess what it is.
// How high would you like the guessing range to be? 50
// I'm thinking of a number! What is it? 25
// Too low. Try again: 30
// Too low. Try again: 40
// Too high. Try again: 36
// Too low. Try again: 37
// Too low. Try again: 38
// Too low. Try again: 39
// You guessed it! It took 7 tries.
// *** You've set a new record for the lowest number of guesses! ***
// Would you like to play again? Y/N:
